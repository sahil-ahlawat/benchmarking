First-Time Setup Commands
1️⃣ Build the Docker Image

cd c:\MAMP\htdocs\learning\benchmarking\k6-loadtester
docker build -t k6-load-tester .

📌 This builds the k6-load-tester image from your specified folder.

2️⃣ Run the Container with Mounted Volume

docker run --rm --name k6-container -v c:\MAMP\htdocs\learning\benchmarking\k6-loadtester:/k6-test k6-load-tester /k6-test/script.js

📌 Runs k6 with a bind mount, allowing script.js to be edited without rebuilding.


On second or later run
Stop container 
docker stop k6-container
Delete container 
docker remove k6-container 
docker stop 
Remove image 
docker rmi k6-load-tester
